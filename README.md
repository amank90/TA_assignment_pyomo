# TA_assignment_pyomo

**Goal** : Match TAs to courses so that our staffing needs are covered in the best way possible.

**Tool** : Pyomo is used for this Linear Programming problem and **GLPK** solver is called for solving.

**Data** : There are two datasets here. One is capturing the information about the TAs and others dataset contains the information about the courses.

**TA dataset Schema information (./data/TA_apps.csv) :-**

- name : Name of the TA
- availability : The days of the week on which TAs are available for lab duty
- R_proficiency : Proficiency in R
- python_proficiency : Proficiency in Python
- can_teach : The courses TA can teach
- enthusiastic : The courses TA is enthusiastic about and can teach

**Courses dataset schema information (./data/MDS_courses_term_1.csv) :-**

- course_number : Course Number
- course_title : Name of the course
- block : The block in which the course belongs 
- primary_lang :  The language in which course is taught
- lab_days : The days on which lab of the course happens



<br><br>

**Constraints**:

- Each course should be assigned to exactly 2 TAs.
- A TA can only cover one course at a time (i.e., in a given block).
- A TA can only be assigned to a course they have listed as "can teach" or "enthusiastic to teach".
- To cover a course, the TA must be available for one of the two lab days (for simplicity).

 **Objective**:

- We want to maximize the number of assigned courses that TAs are enthusiastic about.
